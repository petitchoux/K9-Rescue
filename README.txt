Final Project for NMA 3041

K9 Rescue is in Assets > Scenes > FinalProj.unity

Summary:

K9 Rescue is a game addressing a modern problem in the style 
of an old arcade game reminiscent of Super Mario Bros. 
In the point of view of a dog, you are on a journey to rescue 
your friends, gather treats, and get back home to your parents.

Inspiration: 

My inspiration for this project was the nonprofit organization 
Korean K9 Rescue. They are based in NYC and focus on banning 
the dog meat trade in Korea and sending the dogs over to New 
York for adoption.

Research:

For this project, I primarily used the 2D UFO tutorial from 
Unity as a guide and reference. I kept the basic idea of a pickup 
game, but I wanted to expand it by changing the setting to give 
it more of an adventure feel. 

Process:

I started this project by setting up the environment, props, 
pickup items, and the player. Then I used the same scripts I made 
following the UFO tutorial and applied it to the player and pickup 
items which in this case were the other animals and treats on the 
map. I did have difficulty and could not get the player to animate 
the way I wanted it to in terms of gravity.
